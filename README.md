# roblox-oof-patcher
A simple script that brings back the old oof sound that was removed from newer ROBLOX clients

No external libraries are required.

Needs to be re run every roblox update but it is future proof so you wont have to download a new version

Making a better version soon with options to change the cursor aswell as automatically change it with every update
